	Hello! I am a 2<sup>nd</sup>-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://ccvl.jhu.edu/">Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning research group</a> at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/">Alan Yuille</a>. My primary research interests lie in the fields of 3D computer vision, robustness, and robotics.

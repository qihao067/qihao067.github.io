<h1> Qihao Liu </h1>

<p><small>
	Hello! I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/">Alan Yuille</a>. My research interests lie in the fields of 3D computer vision, robustness, and robotics.
</small></p>

<p><small>
	Before that, I received my Bachelors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have also spent great time at Bytedance (with Dr. <a href="https://songbai.site/">Song Bai</a>).
